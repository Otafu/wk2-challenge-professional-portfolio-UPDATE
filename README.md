# PERSONAL PORTfOLIO - Clinton Tarzia
This challenge required me to pull from my HTML and CSS knowledge from the first two weeks of this boot camp. Its taking a little bit to retain, but its slowly taking.

# Description
The links all check out in the nav section and will lead to different parts of the page. The resume is just an image off the internet and not my own. The project boxes are responsive to the sizing of the page and adjusts depending what device it is being viewed on including mobile. Instead of utilizing my current coding projects (which were minimal), I went ahead and link the current websites I do E-commerce photography for. I used one of my better angles for the photograph as well.
